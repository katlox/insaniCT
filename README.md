# InsaniCT
A Cheat Engine cheat table for an old insane fish game v1.1.

It is recommended you backup your data before using this cheat table.
## Features
This table includes a mix of quality of life improvements, cheats, as well as easier access to variables to fix bugged saves, like invalid tank/levels.
### Quality of Life
#### Multi-Client
You'll need to use cheat engine to launch the game with this cheat table, enable this option, and then let the game continue to start. Won't work if you launch through DRM launcher.
#### Virtual Tank afk bypass
Pets in the virtual tank that collect shells fall asleep after roughly 3 minutes. This option disables that and makes for a decent alternative to the screensaver.
### Cheats
- Anything that costs shells is free
- Anything that costs money is free
- Unlimited pets
- No aliens
- Unlimited Food
- Pause fish hunger
- Disable death from starvation
- No game over (free guppy if all fish are dead, doesn't work on final boss)

## Compatibility
This should work with most, if not all v1.1 variants. I've tested 5 so far and haven't had any issues. If you are trying to use this and you can't activate anything, then your version may not work or you attached to the DRM launcher that might have the same name `Insaniquarium.exe`. If you're using a trial or have certain DRM's, the process name could be `popcapgame1.exe`. Go to File -> open processes -> processes tab to find it.
